# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN

In the world of artificial neural networks (ANN), predicting gre admissions becomes an exciting application. Using ANN, we create a predictive model that learns patterns from historical data, considering factors such as GRE scores, GPA, and other relevant features. The network optimizes its parameters during training to make accurate predictions regarding the likelihood of admission.

Machine Learning Model for Admission Predictions using Artificial Neural Networks. This project applies a neural network to predict graduate admissions based on various student characteristics. The model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, utilizes a Sequential architecture with dense layers and ReLU activations for regression tasks. Ideal for educational institutions aiming to understand factors influencing admission decisions."

This description gives a clear overview of the project’s purpose, the technologies used, and the model's nature. It helps potential users or contributors quickly understand the project’s goal and how it's approached technically.
